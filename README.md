# ExReason


Using https://parceljs.org/reasonML.html with "in-source", on bsconfig.json.
Parcel still doesn't support to point compiled files to "lib", but anyway, 
to hide .bs.js files, on VIM,  you can use:

```
let NERDTreeIgnore = ['\.bs.js$']                                                                                                                              

```
